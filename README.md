## HOW ?

* GIT
* Markdown
* HTML
* CSS 
* JavaScript

It was difficult to work in team on this kind of exercise. Everyone has a different level and working together in the same JS document was really hard.
Anyway, we managed to find a way to have a nice result !
We worked on Meet to share our results rigth away and that's how we found some good ideas to improve our game. 
The team spirit was good and that's why we were able to work together despite the difficulties encountered.
Our goal was to make a funny Cookie Clicker and we think that this one is achieved.
